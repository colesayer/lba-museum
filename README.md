## LBA Museum Page

### Description
This is a sample Museum Website for Linked by Air; built with HTML5, SASS, and Javascript. Tested in current versions of Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.

I utilized JS ES6 class syntax to organize javascript by pages for future expandability. I created an api class to simulate server calls, rather than hardcoding HTML markup. (In production, I would transpose the ES6 syntax to ES5 using Babel, as currently it's not supported by Internet Explorer.)

I used SASS to preprocess the CSS, assigning the page's fonts, colors, and vertical margins to variables allowing for easy adjustments, and mixins to abstract away some of the cross-browser syntax. Everything is responsive, including typography.

I also leveraged CSS browser optimizations to handle performance on rollovers.


Made a change.
